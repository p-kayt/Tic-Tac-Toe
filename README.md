# Tic Tac Toe - React + TypeScript

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with React, TypeScript. It includes features such as player turns, win detection, and a match history.

## Description

The Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw. The game also keeps track of the match history.
